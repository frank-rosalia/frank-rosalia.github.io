title: "Graduating from LSE and Transformer Sonnets" 
date: 2020-09-01

It has been quite some time since I started this page. Oh how much the world has changed since then... I was living in London, in the midst of a three-year relationship and allowed to exist within six feet of another human being without a mask. COVID-19 has really thrown us all down a life-changing rabbit hole. In spite of all the setbacks that were present this Spring, I finished my degree at LSE! I feel incredibly accomplished for having done so and am so proud of all the hardwork exhibited by my entire program. As we step out in the real world it is now time for us to get jobs! 

## Computer generated Shakespearean sonnets

I decided to build a Transformer architecture within Keras for my final project for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. I fed the model the entire corpus of Shakespearean sonnets and will be including a few of the examples here because they are hilarious and amazing. All of the sonnets-- save for the titles which were made by me-- were created using inputs of a short primer word or phrase and the output is a sonnet ala Shakespeare. 

### True Love's Journey
th' love mak'st waste only love my love 
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish 
alas 'tis fearing with time's tyranny 
mine own self and yours live of true love 
give not a windy night a rainy morrow 

### The Everyman's Plight
what potions of this make this make me strong 
give the pine and keeps the time to your treasure 
when sometime were bid ere by living be 
he lends her some black some part 
and wherefore and not lovely make the store 

### Time's Austere Leer
your own glass or your self in your decease 
despite away wrinkles thy golden time 
these vacant leaves his mind's imprint quill 
upon the mortal tongue 
loving offenders thy heart on reason
