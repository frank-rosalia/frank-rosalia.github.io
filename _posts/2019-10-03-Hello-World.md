title: Hello World!: My First Blog Post on GitHub! 
date: 2019-10-03

Working through this tutorial by Hank Quinlan on how to use GitHub to host a personal website and blog. 
I really like the simplicity with which he is explaining all of the content. This is all being done as a part of the homework for my Managing and Visualizing Data Course at the London School of Economics and Political Science. 
I hope to continue to use this tool to track my University experience moving forward!
